# Dispatch closure — 2026-07-14T17:06Z (second-wave re-detection; concurrent wave already closed)

## Trigger
Cron dispatcher returned `has_work: true` with two items: `new_journals` (2 files) + `new_emails` (9 owner + 3 Indigo threads). Detected at 16:55:06Z.

## Classification (all second-wave)
- **Journals:** both `new_files` (`dispatch-wave-20260714T165052Z.json`, `mentor-light-20260714T165010Z.json`) already present in BOTH eval stores → journal second-wave.
- **Email:** all 12 threads `is_new: false`; verified each `thread_id` in `evidence.jsonl` (3–107 grep matches each, NOT just trusting prior wave's `verified_in_evidence` claim per `references/email-evidence-verification-gap.md`). → email second-wave.
- **Concurrent-wave exception:** a LATER wave `dispatch-wave-20260714T165606Z.json` (timestamp 16:56:06 > detected_at 16:55:06) already fully processed the same threads/files as second-wave no-op. Per the 1459Z gotcha: did NOT re-run Forge/Mentor/Praxis, did NOT mint/rewrite a wave journal.

## Closure actions (no pipeline re-run)
1. Bounded per-skill `os.listdir` gap walk of `commons/journals/<skill>/2026-07-14/` vs both eval stores; bridged residual post-dispatch cron journals into BOTH eval stores (`ocas-custodian/.../escalation-exec-20260714T170336Z.json`, `light-scan-2026-07-14T1703Z.json`). Idempotent append by full relative path.
2. Advanced `ingest_state.last_ingest_run` from stale `16:50:37` → `17:06:16` (past max mtime of all processed/bridged journals). This was the root cause of the re-fire loop.
3. Fixed BOTH email state files (owner + indigo) `last_email_check.json`: `last_dispatch` → `17:04:20`, `verified_second_wave: true`, `last_dispatch_wave` → the concurrent wave `dispatch-wave-20260714T165606Z`. The bridge script NEVER touches these; a stale `last_dispatch` re-fires the email item forever.

## Pitfalls hit this run
- **Phantom dispatch-wave journal:** `evidence.jsonl` referenced `dispatch-wave-20260714T165606Z.json` but NO file exists on disk (`ls` confirms). Did NOT register it (gap walk only considers on-disk files). Never register a journal whose on-disk file is absent.
- **`patch` corrupted a JSON state file:** patching `owner/last_email_check.json` with a non-contiguous old_string dropped `last_check_ts` and inserted a DUPLICATE `"timestamp"` key (malformed JSON). Re-read + `write_file` the full corrected object fixed it. Rule: for scattered multi-field JSON edits in a single cron run, re-read then `write_file` (JSON lint validates); reserve `patch` for single contiguous localized edits. Full guidance now in the SKILL.md `bridge_explicit_run.py … email_triage stub` gotcha.

## Verification (assert before exit)
- Both detected `new_files` present in both eval stores ✓
- `last_ingest_run` advanced past all processed mtimes ✓
- Both email state files valid JSON, `verified_second_wave: true` ✓
- GENUINE GAP (excl custodian) = 0 ✓
