# OCAS Shared Schemas

Spec Version: 1.3
Author: Indigo Karasu

Changes from 1.2: added PortfolioOutcomeRecord schema (Rally domain extension); added ConsumptionSignal and ItemRecord schemas (Taste domain extensions); added EvaluationResult schema (Mentor domain extension).

Changes from 1.0: updated JournalEntry minimum fields to match journal spec v1.3 (added journal_type, journal_spec_version); updated ConfigBase to reference central storage path; added InsightProposal schema (Corvus output); added BehavioralSignal schema (Corvus→Praxis); added VariantProposal and VariantDecision schemas (Mentor→Forge); clarified extension rules.

---

## Purpose

This document defines canonical schemas for data objects that appear across multiple OCAS skills. Skills reference these definitions rather than redefining them independently.

Skills may extend these schemas with domain-specific fields. Base fields defined here must be present and semantically consistent.

---

## DecisionRecord

Used by: all skills that make consequential decisions.

Every decision that changes behavior, triggers an external action, or produces an interpretive output should be recorded as a DecisionRecord.

```json
{
  "decision_id": "string — unique identifier (dec_{hash})",
  "timestamp": "string — ISO 8601",
  "skill_id": "string — which skill made the decision",
  "skill_version": "string",
  "decision_type": "string — skill-defined category (e.g., route, execute, promote, ingest, safety)",
  "description": "string — brief human-readable summary",
  "evidence_refs": ["string — references to signals, sources, or artifacts that informed the decision"],
  "outcome": "string — what was decided",
  "confidence": "string — high|med|low",
  "side_effects": "string|null — description of any external effects"
}
```

---

## Signal

Used by: skills that emit observations to be ingested by Elephas.

See `spec-ocas-ontology.md` for the full evidence model and signal delivery mechanism.

```json
{
  "signal_id": "string — unique identifier (sig_{hash})",
  "timestamp": "string — ISO 8601",
  "source_skill": "string — skill that emitted the signal",
  "source_journal_type": "string — Observation|Action|Research",
  "payload": {
    "type": "string — entity type or signal category",
    "data": "object — the observed information"
  },
  "confidence": "string — high|med|low",
  "status": "string — active|consumed"
}
```

---

## Candidate

```json
{
  "candidate_id": "string — unique identifier",
  "timestamp": "string — ISO 8601",
  "source_skill": "string",
  "proposed_node": {
    "type": "string — Entity|Place|Concept|Thing or subclass",

  "confidence": "string — high|med|low",
  "status": "string — pending|confirmed|rejected|merged"
}
```

---

## InsightProposal

## Domain Extension Schemas

The schemas below are skill-specific extensions of shared base schemas. They are documented here for cross-skill discoverability. Each extension follows the rules in the Extension Rules section — base fields are preserved.

---

### PortfolioOutcomeRecord

**Extends:** JournalEntry (decision field)
**Used by:** Rally (writes), Vesper (reads via cooperative interface)
**Written to:** `{agent_root}/commons/data/ocas-rally/reports/YYYY-MM-DD-daily.json`

```json
{
  "report_date": "string — ISO 8601 date",
  "portfolio_value": "number — total portfolio value in USD",
  "daily_return": "number — daily return as decimal (e.g., 0.012 = 1.2%)",
  "ytd_return": "number — year-to-date return",
  "drawdown": "number — current drawdown from peak as decimal",
  "regime_score": "number — 0.0 to 1.0, market regime assessment",

## Extension Rules

Skills may extend any shared schema by adding fields. They must not:
- Remove or rename base fields
- Change the semantic meaning of base fields
- Change the type of base fields

Extended schemas document which base schema they extend and what fields they add.
